It&#39;s a complete blockchain-in-memory that runs only on your development machine. It processes transactions instantly instead of waiting for the default block time -- so you can test that your code works quickly -- and it tells you immediately when your smart contracts run into errors. It also makes a great client for automated testing, and Truffle knows how to use its special features to speed up test runtime by almost 90%.\nWhen Deploying\nGeth (go-ethereum): https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum\nWebThree (cpp-ethereum): https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella\nMore: https://www.ethereum.org/cli\n\nThere are many official and unofficial Ethereum clients available for you to use. You should use these clients after you&#39;ve sufficiently tested your dapp with the EthereumJS TestRPC and you&#39;re ready to deploy to the Ethereum network. These are full client implementations that include mining, networking, blocks and transaction processing, and Truffle can deploy to these clients without any extra configuration.\n"},"project":{"id":"project","title":"Creating a project","path":"getting_started/project","content":"Create a Project Folder First create a project folder. You can do this through your favorite file explorer or by running the following on the command line:\n$ mkdir myproject\n\nInitialize Your ProjectNext, initialize your Truffle project by performing the following in the command line:\n$ cd myproject\n$ truffle init\n\nOnce completed, you&#39;ll now have a project structure with the following items:\n\napp/ - directory where your application files go by default.

By default you&#39;re given an example Solidity contract file and an example Solidity library file, both with filenames ending in .sol. Although a Solidity library is different than a contract, for documentation purposes we&#39;re going to lump these into the same word, &quot;contracts&quot;.\nCommandTo compile your contracts, simply run:\n$ truffle compile\n\nTruffle will compile only the contracts that have been changed since the last compile, to reduce any unnecessarily compilation. If you&#39;d like to override this behavior, run the above command with the --compile-all option.\nConventionTruffle expects your contract files to define contracts that match their filenames exactly. For instance, if you have a file called MyContract.sol, one of the following should exist within the contract file:\ncontract MyContract {\n  ...\n}\n// or\nlibrary MyContract {\n  ...\n}\nFilename matching is case-sensitive, meaning if your filename isn&#39;t capitalized, your contract name shouldn&#39;t be capitalized either. We recommend capitalizing every word, however, like above.\nDependenciesYou can declare contract dependencies using Solidity&#39;s import command. Truffle will compile contracts in the correct order and link libraries automatically when necessary.\nArtifactsArtifacts of your compilation will be place in the ./build/contracts directory, relative to your project. This directory will be created if it does not exist. These artifacts are integral to the inner workings of Truffle, and they play and important part to the successful deployment of your application. You should not edit these files by hand as they&#39;ll be overwritten by contract compilation and deployment.\n"},"migrations":{"id":"migrations","title":"Running migrations","path":"getting_started/migrations","content":"Migrations are Javascript files that help you deploy contracts to the Ethereum network. These files are responsible for staging your deployment tasks, and they&#39;re written under the assumption that your deployment needs will change over time. As your project evolves, you&#39;ll create new migration scripts to further this evolution on the blockchain. A history of previously run migrations is recorded on-chain through a special Migrations contract, detailed below.\nCommand To run your migrations, run the following:\n$ truffle migrate\n\nThis will run all migrations located within your project&#39;s migrations directory. If your migrations were previously run successfully, truffle migrate will start execution from the last migration that was ran, running only newly created migrations. If no new migrations exists, truffle migrate won&#39;t perform any action at all. You can use the --reset option to run all your migrations from the beginning.\nMigration FilesA simple migration file looks like this:\nFilename: 4_example_migration.js\nmodule.exports = function(deployer) {\n  // deployment steps\n  deployer.deploy(MyContract);\n};\n\nNote that the filename is prefixed with a number and is suffixed by a description. The numbered prefix is required in order to record whether the migration ran successfully. The suffix is purely for human readability and comprehension.\nThe function exported by each migration accepts a deployer object as a first parameter. This object aides in deployment by both providing a clear syntax as well as performing some of the more mundane duties of contract deployments, such as saving deployed artifacts for later use. The deployer object is your main interface for staging deployment tasks, and its API is described at the bottom of this page.\nLike all code within Truffle, your contract abstractions are provided and initialized for you so you can easily interact with the Ethereum network. These abstractions are an integral part of the deployment process, as you&#39;ll see below.\nInitial MigrationTruffle requires you to have a Migrations contract in order to use the Migrations feature. This contract must contain a specific interface, but you&#39;re free to edit this contract at will. For most projects, this contract will be deployed initially as the first migration and won&#39;t be updated again. You will also receive this contract by default when creating a new project with truffle init.\nFilename: contracts/Migrations.sol\ncontract Migrations {\n  address public owner;\n\n  // A function with the signature `last_completed_migration()`, returning a uint, is required.\n  uint public last_completed_migration;\n\n  modifier restricted() {\n    if (msg.sender == owner) _\n  }\n\n  function Migrations() {\n    owner = msg.sender;\n  }\n\n  // A function with the signature `setCompleted(uint)` is required.\n  function setCompleted(uint completed) restricted {\n    last_completed_migration = completed;\n  }\n\n  function upgrade(address new_address) restricted {\n    Migrations upgraded = Migrations(new_address);\n    upgraded.setCompleted(last_completed_migration);\n  }\n}\nYou must deploy this contract inside your first migration in order to take advantage of the Migrations feature. To do so, create the following migration:\nFilename: migrations/1_initial_migration.js\nmodule.exports = function(deployer) {\n  // Deploy the Migrations contract as our only task\n  deployer.deploy(Migrations);\n};\n\nFrom here, you can create new migrations with increasing numbered prefixes to deploy other contracts and perform further deployment steps.\nDeployerYour migration files will use the deployer to stage deployment tasks. As such, you can write deployment tasks synchronously and they&#39;ll be executed in the correct order:\n// Stage deploying A before B\ndeployer.deploy(A);\ndeployer.deploy(B);\n\nAlternatively, each function on the deployer can be used as a Promise, to queue up deployment tasks that depend on the execution of the previous task:\n// Deploy A, then deploy B, passing in A&#39;s newly deployed address\ndeployer.deploy(A).then(function() {\n  return deployer.deploy(B, A.address);\n});\n\nIt is possible to write your deployment as a single promise chain if you find that syntax to be more clear. The deployer API is discussed at the bottom of this page.\nNetwork ConsiderationsIt is possible to run deployment steps conditionally based on the network being deployed to. This is an advanced feature, so see the Networks section first before continuing.\nTo conditionally stage deployment steps, write your migrations so that they accept a second parameter, called network. Example:\nmodule.exports = function(deployer, network) {\n  // Add demo data if we&#39;re not deploying to the live network.\n  if (network != &quot;live&quot;) {\n    deployer.exec(&quot;add_demo_data.js&quot;);\n  }\n}\n\nDeployer APIThe deployer contains many functions available to simplify your migrations.\ndeployer.deploy(contract, args...)Deploy a specific contract, specified by the contract object, with optional constructor arguments. This is useful for singleton contracts, such that only one instance of this contract exists for your dapp. This will set the address of the contract after deployment (i.e., Contract.address will equal the newly deployed address), and it will override any previous address stored.\nYou can optionally pass an array of contracts, or an array of arrays, to speed up deployment of multiple contracts.\nNote that deploy will automatically link any required libraries to the contracts that are being deployed, if the addresses for those libraries are available. You must deploy your libraries first before deploying a contract that depends on one of those libraries.\nExamples:\n// Deploy a single contract without constructor arguments\ndeployer.deploy(A);\n\n// Deploy a single contract with constructor arguments\ndeployer.deploy(A, arg1, arg2, ...);\n\n// Deploy multiple contracts, some with arguments and some without.\n// This is quicker than writing three `deployer.deploy()` statements as the deployer\n// can perform the deployment as a batched request.\ndeployer.deploy([\n  [A, arg1, arg2, ...],\n  B,\n  [C, arg1]\n]);\n\ndeployer.link(library, destinations)Link an already-deployed library to a contract or multiple contracts. destinations can be a single contract or an array of multiple contracts. If any contract within the destination doesn&#39;t rely on the library being linked, the deployer will ignore that contract.\nThis is useful for contracts that you don&#39;t intend to deploy (i.e. are not singletons) yet will need linking before being used in your dapp.\nExample:\n// Deploy library LibA, then link LibA to contract B\ndeployer.deploy(LibA);\ndeployer.link(LibA, B);\n\n// Link LibA to many contracts\ndeployer.link(LibA, [B, C, D]);\n\ndeployer.autolink(contract)Link all libraries that contract depends on to that contract. This requires that all libraries contract depends on have already been deployed or were queued for deployment in a previous step.\nExample:\n// Assume A depends on a LibB and LibC\ndeployer.deploy([LibB, LibC]);\ndeployer.autolink(A);\n\nAlternatively, you can call autolink() without a first parameter. This will link all libraries available to the contracts that depend on them. Ensure your libraries are deployed first before calling this function.\nExample:\n// Link *all* libraries to all available contracts\ndeployer.autolink();\n\ndeployer.then(function() {...})Just like a promise, run an arbitrary deployment step.\nExample:\ndeployer.then(function() {\n  // Create a new version of A\n  return A.new();\n}).then(function(instance) {\n  // Set the new instance of A&#39;s address on B.\n  var b = B.deployed();\n  return b.setA(instance.address);\n});\n\ndeployer.exec(pathToFile)Execute a file meant to be run with truffle exec as part of the deployment. See the Writing external scripts section for more information.\nExample:\n// Run the script, relative to the migrations file.\ndeployer.exec(&quot;../path/to/file/demo_data.js&quot;);\n\n"},"build":{"id":"build","title":"Building your application","path":"getting_started/build","content":"Default Builder Truffle comes standard with a default build system which is meant to be easy to use. It&#39;s not suitable for every project, and you may choose to use other build systems to package your application. See the advanced build processes section for more details. Note that the default builder is targeted towards web applications, but it can be easily swapped out for another build process that works better for command line tools and libraries.\nFeaturesThe default builder comes with a few standard niceties meant to get you started quickly:\n\nAutomatic bootstrapping of your application within the browser, importing your compiled contract artifacts, deployed contract information and Ethereum client configuration automatically.\nInclusion of recommended dependencies, including web3 and Truffle Artifactor.\nSupport for ES6 and JSX built-in.\nSASS support for manageable CSS.\nAnd UglifyJS support for creating minified versions of your Javascript assets.\n\nConfigurationThe default builder gives you complete control over how you want to organize your files and folders, but the default directory structure looks like this:\napp/\n- javascripts/\n  - app.js\n- stylesheets/\n  - app.css\n- images/\n- index.html\n\nIt&#39;s corresponding configuration within your project configuration looks very similar:\n{\n  &quot;build&quot;: {\n    // Copy ./app/index.html (right hand side) to ./build/index.html (left hand side).\n    &quot;index.html&quot;: &quot;index.html&quot;,\n\n    // Process all files in the array, concatenating them together\n    // to create a resultant app.js\n    &quot;app.js&quot;: [\n      &quot;javascripts/app.js&quot;\n    ],\n\n    // Process all files in the array, concatenating them together\n    // to create a resultant app.css\n    &quot;app.css&quot;: [\n      &quot;stylesheets/app.scss&quot;\n    ],\n\n    // Copy over the whole directory to the build destination.\n    &quot;images/&quot;: &quot;images/&quot;\n  }\n}\n\nThis configuration describes &quot;targets&quot; (left hand side) with files, folders and arrays of files that make up the targets&#39; contents (right hand side). Each target will be produced by processing the files on the right hand side based on their file extension, concatenating the results together and then saving the resultant file (the target) into the build destination. Where a string is specified on the right hand side instead of an array, that file will be processed, if needed, and then copied over directly. If the string ends in a &quot;/&quot;, it will be interpreted as a directory and the directory will be copied over without further processing. All paths specified on the right hand side are relative to the app/ directory.\nYou can change this configuration and directory structure at any time. You aren&#39;t required to have a javascripts and stylesheets directory, for example, but make sure you edit your configuration accordingly.\nSpecial note: If you want the default builder to bootstrap your application on the frontend, make sure you have a build target called app.js which the default builder can append code to. It will not bootstrap your application with any other filename.\nCommandTo build your frontend, simply run:\n$ truffle build\n\nBuild ArtifactsYour build artifacts are saved within the ./build directory, along side compiled deployed contract artifacts in ./build/contracts.\nConsiderationsThe default builder is easy to use for most projects, and allows you to quickly get started. However, it has some drawbacks:\n\nIt doesn&#39;t currently support import, require, etc., provided to you by tools like Browserify, Webpack, and CommonJS, making dependency management harder than it should be.\nIt&#39;s a custom build system and doesn&#39;t easily integrate with other popular build systems.\nIt is extensible, but again, using custom methods and APIs.\n\nThe default builder will likely be deprecated and replaced in future versions of Truffle, but it remains the default to continue to support dapps previously built on top of it. Truffle provides many ways for you to switch to a different build process, however, and you can find many examples in the advanced build processes section.\n\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n  ga('create', 'UA-83874933-1', 'auto');\n  ga('send', 'pageview');\n\n"},"contracts":{"id":"contracts","title":"Interacting with your contracts","path":"getting_started/contracts","content":"Background The standard method of interacting with the Ethereum network is through the Web3 library, created by the Ethereum foundation. Although this library is very useful, its current contract abstraction makes interacting with contracts difficult, especially for those new to Ethereum development. To smooth the learning curve, Truffle uses the Truffle Artifactor library, built on top of Web3, which aims to make interacting with contracts much easier.\nReading &amp; Writing DataThe Ethereum network makes a distinction between writing data to the network and reading data from it, and this distinction plays a significant part in how you write your application. In general, writing data is called a transaction whereas reading data is called a call. Transactions and calls are treated very differently, and have the following characteristics:\nTransactionsTransactions fundamentally change the state of the network. A transaction can be as simple as sending Ether to another account, or as complicated as executing a contract function or adding a new contract to the network. The defining characteristic of a transaction is that it writes (or changes) data. Transactions cost Ether to run, known as &quot;gas&quot;, and transactions take time to process. When you execute a contract&#39;s function via a transaction, you cannot receive that function&#39;s return value because the transaction isn&#39;t processed immediately. In general, functions meant to be executed via a transaction will not return a value; they will return a transaction id instead. So in summary, transactions:\n\nCost gas (Ether)\nChange the state of the network\nAren&#39;t processed immediately\nWon&#39;t expose a return value (only a transaction id).\n\nCallsCalls, on the other hand, are very different. Calls can be used to execute code on the network, though no data will be permanently changed. Calls are free to run, and their defining characteristic is that they read data. When you execute a contract function via a call you will receive the return value immediately. In summary, calls:\n\nAre free (do not cost gas)\nDo not change the state of the network\nAre processed immediately\nWill expose a return value (hooray!)\n\nChoosing between a transaction and a call is as simple as deciding whether you want to read data, or write it.\nAbstractionIn order to appreciate the usefulness of a contract abstraction, we first need a contract to talk about. We&#39;ll use the MetaCoin contract provided for you by default.\nimport &quot;ConvertLib.sol&quot;;\n\ncontract MetaCoin {\n  mapping (address =&gt; uint) balances;\n\n    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);\n\n    function MetaCoin() {\n        balances[tx.origin] = 10000;\n    }\n\n    function sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {\n        if (balances[msg.sender] &lt; amount) return false;\n        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n        balances[receiver] += amount;\n        Transfer(msg.sender, receiver, amount);\n        return true;\n    }\n    function getBalanceInEth(address addr) returns(uint){\n        return ConvertLib.convert(getBalance(addr),2);\n    }\n    function getBalance(address addr) returns(uint) {\n        return balances[addr];\n    }\n}\n\nThis contract has three methods aside from the constructor (sendCoin, getBalanceInEth, and getBalance). All three methods can be executed as either a transaction or a call.\nNow let&#39;s look at the Javascript object called MetaCoin provided for us by Truffle and Truffle Artifactor, made available within our frontend:\n// Print the deployed version of MetaCoin\nconsole.log(MetaCoin.deployed());\n\n// outputs:\n//\n// Contract\n// - address: &quot;0xa9f441a487754e6b27ba044a5a8eb2eec77f6b92&quot;\n// - allEvents: ()\n// - getBalance: ()\n// - getBalanceInEth: ()\n// - sendCoin: ()\n\nNotice that the abstraction contains the exact same functions that exist within our contract. It also contains an address which points to the deployed version of the MetaCoin contract.\nExecuting Contract FunctionsUsing the abstraction you can easily execute contract functions on the Ethereum network.\nMaking a TransactionThere are three functions on the MetaCoin contract that we can execute. If you analyze each of them, you&#39;ll see that sendCoin is the only function that aims to make changes to the network. The goal of sendCoin is to &quot;send&quot; some Meta coins from one account to the next, and these changes should persist.\nWhen calling sendCoin, we&#39;ll execute it as a transaction. In the following example, we&#39;ll send 10 Meta coin from one account to another, in a way that persists changes on the network:\nvar account_one = &quot;0x1234...&quot;; // an address\nvar account_two = &quot;0xabcd...&quot;; // another address\n\nvar meta = MetaCoin.deployed();\nmeta.sendCoin(account_two, 10, {from: account_one}).then(function(tx_id) {\n  // If this callback is called, the transaction was successfully processed.\n  // Note that Truffle Artifactor takes care of watching the network and triggering\n  // this callback.\n  alert(&quot;Transaction successful!&quot;)\n}).catch(function(e) {\n  // There was an error! Handle it.\n})\n\nThere are a few things interesting about the above code:\n\nWe called the abstraction&#39;s sendCoin function directly. This will result in a transaction by default (i.e, writing data) instead of call.\nWhen the transaction is successful, the callback function isn&#39;t fired until the transaction is processed. This makes life easy and means you don&#39;t have to check the status of the transaction yourself.\nWe passed an object as the third parameter to sendCoin. Note that the sendCoin function in our Solidity contract doesn&#39;t have a third parameter. What you see above is a special object that can always be passed as the last parameter to a function that lets you edit specific details about the transaction. Here, we set the from address ensuring this transaction came from account_one.\n\nMaking a CallContinuing with MetaCoin, notice the getBalance function is a great candidate for reading data from the network. It doesn&#39;t need to make any changes, as it just returns the MetaCoin balance of the address passed to it. Let&#39;s give it a shot:\nvar account_one = &quot;0x1234...&quot;; // an address\n\nvar meta = MetaCoin.deployed();\nmeta.getBalance.call(account_one, {from: account_one}).then(function(balance) {\n  // If this callback is called, the call was successfully executed.\n  // Note that this returns immediately without any waiting.\n  // Let&#39;s print the return value.\n  console.log(balance.toNumber());\n}).catch(function(e) {\n  // There was an error! Handle it.\n})\n\nWhat&#39;s interesting here:\n\nWe had to execute the .call() function explicitly to let the Ethereum network know we&#39;re not intending to persist any changes.\nWe received a return value instead of a transaction id on success. Note that since the Etheruem network can handle very large numbers, we&#39;re given a BigNumber object which we then convert to a number.\n\nWarning: We convert the return value to a number because in this example the numbers are small. However, if you try to convert a BigNumber that&#39;s larger than the largest integer supported by Javascript, you&#39;ll likely run into errors or unexpected behavior.\nCatching EventsYour contracts can fire events that you can catch to gain more insight into what your contracts are doing. The event API is the same as Web3; along with the example below, see the Web3 documentation for more information.\nvar meta = MetaCoin.deployed();\nvar transfers = meta.Transfer({fromBlock: &quot;latest&quot;});\ntransfers.watch(function(error, result) {\n  // This will catch all Transfer events, regardless of how they originated.\n  if (error == null) {\n    console.log(result.args);\n  }\n}\n\nMethod: deployed()Each contract abstraction has a method called deployed(), which you saw used above. Calling this function on the main contract object will give you an instance of the abstraction that represents the contract previously deployed to the network.\nvar meta = MetaCoin.deployed();\n\nWarning: This will only work successfully for contracts that have been deployed using truffle deploy and are set to be deployed within your project configuration. This function will throw an error if your contract does not meet this criteria.\nMethod: at()Similar to deployed(), you can get an instance of the abstraction that represents the contract at a specific address. Here, we expect to have an already deployed contract at the address &quot;0x1234...&quot;:\nvar meta = MetaCoin.at(&quot;0x1234...&quot;)\n\nWarning: This function will not error if your address is incorrect or your address points to the wrong contract. Instead, contract functions called on the abstraction instance will fail. Ensure you have the correct address when using at().\nMethod: new()You can use this method to deploy a completely new instance of a contract onto the network. Here&#39;s how:\nMetaCoin.new().then(function(instance) {\n  // `instance` is a new instance of the abstraction.\n  // If this callback is called, the deployment was successful.\n  console.log(instance.address);\n}).catch(function(e) {\n  // There was an error! Handle it.\n});\n\nNote that this is a transaction and will change the state of the network.\n"},"testing":{"id":"testing","title":"Testing your contracts","path":"getting_started/testing","content":"Framework Truffle uses the Mocha testing framework for automated testing and Chai for assertions. We think these two libraries together make automated testing a breeze, and so we&#39;ve built on top of them to provide you a way to write simple and manageable automated tests for your contracts.\nLocationAll test files should be located in the ./tests directory. Truffle will only run test files with the following file extensions: .js, .es, .es6, and .jsx. All other files are ignored.\nWriting TestsEach test file should contain at least one call to Mocha&#39;s describe() function as shown in the MochaJS Documentation. Alternatively, you can use Truffle&#39;s custom contract() function which works like Mocha&#39;s describe() but with a few added features:\n\nBefore each contract() function is run, your contracts are redeployed to the running Ethereum client so the tests within it run with a clean contract state.\nThe contract() function provides a list of available accounts as a second parameter with which you can write tests against.\n\nUse the contract() function when you&#39;re writing tests that interact with your contracts. Use describe() when you&#39;re writing tests that don&#39;t interact with any contracts.\nExample TestHere&#39;s an example test provided for you by truffle init. This will tell Truffle (and Mocha) to deploy your contracts first and then run the test specified in the it() block.\ncontract(&#39;MetaCoin&#39;, function(accounts) {\n  it(&quot;should put 10000 MetaCoin in the first account&quot;, function() {\n    // Get a reference to the deployed MetaCoin contract, as a JS object.\n    var meta = MetaCoin.deployed();\n\n    // Get the MetaCoin balance of the first account and assert that it&#39;s 10000.\n    return meta.getBalance.call(accounts[0]).then(function(balance) {\n      assert.equal(balance.valueOf(), 10000, &quot;10000 wasn&#39;t in the first account&quot;);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nNote that the string &#39;MetaCoin&#39; passed to the contract() function is for display purposes only.\nContractsTruffle provides a contract abstraction for you that makes interacting with your contracts easy. You can see this abstraction at work within the var meta = MetaCoin.deployed() line of code. Truffle ensures that interacting with contracts within your tests is the same as interacting with contracts within your frontend and within your migrations, and you can read more about that interaction in the next section.\nCommandTo run all tests, simply run:\n$ truffle test\nAlternatively, you can specify a path to a specific file you want to run, e.g.,\n$ truffle test ./path/to/test/file.js\n\nConsiderationsThe EthereumJS TestRPC is significantly faster than other clients when running automated tests. Moreover, the TestRPC contains special features which Truffle takes advantage of to speed up test runtime even more. As a general workflow, we recommend you use the TestRPC during normal development and testing, and then run your tests once against Geth or another official Ethereum client when you&#39;re gearing up to deploy to the live network.\nAdvancedTruffle gives you access to Mocha&#39;s configuration so you can change how Mocha behaves. See the project configuration section for more details.\n"},"console":{"id":"console","title":"Using the console","path":"getting_started/console","content":"Background Sometimes it&#39;s nice to work with your contracts interactively for testing and debugging purposes, or for executing transactions by hand. Truffle provides you an easy way to do this via an interactive console, with your contracts available and ready to use.\nCommandTo fire up the console, simply run:\n$ truffle console\n\nThis will load up a console using the default network, connecting automatically to the running Ethereum client. You can override this using the --network option.

For instance, you can type migrate --reset within the console, and it will be interpreted the same as if you ran truffle migrate --reset from outside the console. Truffle&#39;s console additionally has the following features:\n\nAll of your compiled contracts are available and ready for use, as if you were developing tests or your frontend, or writing a migration.\nAfter each command (such as migrate --reset) your contracts are reprovisioned so you can start using the newly assigned addresses and binaries immediately.\nThe web3 library is made available and is set to connect to your Ethereum client.\nAll commands that return a promise will automatically be resolved, and the result printed, removing the need to use .then() for simple commands. e.g.,\n\ntruffle(default)&gt; MyContract.deployed().getValue.call(); //\n5\n"},"scripts":{"id":"scripts","title":"Writing external scripts","path":"getting_started/scripts","content":"Background Often you may want to run external scripts that interact with your contracts.

This file is a Javascript file and can execute any code necessary to create your configuration. It must export an object representing your project configuration like the example below.\nResolving Naming Conflicts on WindowsWhen using the Command Prompt on Windows, the default configuration file name can cause a conflict with the truffle executable. If this is the case, we recommend using Windows PowerShell or Git BASH as these shells do not have this conflict. Alternatively, you can rename the configuration file to truffle-config.js to avoid this conflict.\nExamplemodule.exports = {\n  build: {\n    &quot;index.html&quot;: &quot;index.html&quot;,\n    &quot;app.js&quot;: [\n      &quot;javascripts/app.js&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;app.css&quot;: [\n      &quot;stylesheets/app.css&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;images/&quot;: &quot;images/&quot;\n  },\n  rpc: {\n    host: &quot;localhost&quot;,\n    port: 8545\n  }\n};\n\nThe default configuration ships with two options specified: build and rpc.

When compiling and running migrations on a specific network, contract artifacts will be saved and recorded for later use. When your contract abstractions detect that your Ethereum client is connected to a specific network, they&#39;ll use the contract artifacts associated that network to simplify app deployment. Networks are identified through Ethereum&#39;s net_version RPC call.\nThe networks object, shown below, is keyed by a network name and contains a corresponding object that defines the parameters of the network. The networks option is not required, but if specified, each network it defines must specify a corresponding network_id. If you&#39;d like a specific network configuration to be associated with every network that doesn&#39;t match any other network in the list, use a network_id of &quot;default&quot;. However, there should only be one default network. Traditionally, the default network is used during development, where contract artifacts don&#39;t matter long-term and the network id continuously changes, for instance, if the TestRPC is restarted.\nThe network name is used for user interface purposes, such as when running your migrations on a specific network:\n$ truffle migrate --network live\n\nYou can optionally specify rpc information for each network. Examples below.\nExample:\nnetworks: {\n  &quot;live&quot;: {\n    network_id: 1, // Ethereum public network\n    // optional config values\n    // host - defaults to &quot;localhost&quot;\n    // port - defaults to 8545\n    // gas\n    // gasPrice\n    // from - default address to use for any transaction Truffle makes during migrations\n  },\n  &quot;morden&quot;: {\n    network_id: 2,        // Official Ethereum test network\n    host: &quot;178.25.19.88&quot;, // Random IP for example purposes (do not use)\n    port: 80\n  },\n  &quot;staging&quot;: {\n    network_id: 1337 // custom private network\n    // use default rpc settings\n  },\n  &quot;development&quot;: {\n    network_id: &quot;default&quot;\n  }\n}\n\nrpcDetails about how to connect to your ethereum client. The host and port keys are required. However, a few other keys are available:\n\nhost: Hostname pointing to the network location of your Ethereum client (usually &quot;localhost&quot; for development).\nport: Port number where your Etheruem client accepts requests. Default is 8545.\ngas: Gas limit used for deploys. Default is 4712388.\ngasPrice: Gas price used for deploys. Default is 100000000000 (100 Shannon).\nfrom: From address used during migrations. If not specified, defaults to the first available account provided by your Ethereum client.\n\nExample:\nrpc: {\n  host: &quot;localhost&quot;,\n  port: 8545\n}\n\nmochaConfiguration options for the MochaJS testing framework. This configuration expects an object as detailed in Mocha&#39;s documentation.\nExample:\nmocha: {\n  useColors: true\n}\n\n"},"networks":{"id":"networks","title":"Networks &amp; App Deployment","path":"advanced/networks","content":"Background Even the smallest project will interact with at the very least two blockchains: One on the developer&#39;s machine, like the EthereumJS TestRPC, and the other representing the network where the developer will eventually deploy their application (this could be the public Ethereum network, or a private consortium network, for instance). Truffle provides a system for managing the build and deployment artifacts for each network, and does so in a way that simplifies final application deployment.\nConfigurationSee the Configuration section for more information.\nSpecifying a NetworkMost Truffle commands will behave differently based on the network specified, and will use that network&#39;s contracts and configuration. You can specify a network using the --network option, like below:\n$ truffle migrate --network live\n\nIn this example, Truffle will run your migrations on the &quot;live&quot; network, which -- if configured like the example -- is associated with the public Ethereum blockchain.\nBuild ArtifactsAs mentioned in the Compiling contracts section, build artifacts are stored in the ./build/contracts directory as .sol.js files. When you compile your contracts or run your migrations using a specific network, Truffle will update those .sol.js files so they contain the information related to that network. When those artifacts are used later -- such as within your frontend or application -- they&#39;ll automatically detect which network the Ethereum client is connected to and use the correct contract artifacts accordingly.\nApplication DeploymentBecause the network is auto-detected by the contract artifacts at runtime, this means that you only need to deploy your application or frontend once. When your application is run, the running Ethereum client will determine which artifacts are used, and this will make your application very flexible. As an example, if you were to deploy your application to http://mydapp.io, you could navigate to that address using your favorite wallet-browser (like MetaMask, or Mist) and your dapp would work correctly regardless of the Ethereum network the wallet-browser was connected to. If the wallet-browser was connected to the live network, your dapp would use the contracts you deployed on the live network. If on Morden, the contracts you deployed to morden would be used.\n"},"build_processes":{"id":"build_processes","title":"Build Processes","path":"advanced/build_processes","content":"Custom Build Processes Throughout Truffle&#39;s history, it&#39;s clear that the default builder is not for everybody. It has some obvious caveats and is less mature than other build systems. With that in mind, Truffle provides you three ways to override the build system in order to get the most out of Truffle while also using your build process of choice.\nRunning an External CommandIf you&#39;d like Truffle to run an external command whenever it triggers a build, simply include that option as a string within your project configuration, like so:\nmodule.exports = {\n  // This will run the `webpack` command on each build.\n  //\n  // The following environment variables will be set when running the command:\n  // WORKING_DIRECTORY: root location of the project\n  // BUILD_DESTINATION_DIRECTORY: expected destination of built assets (important for `truffle serve`)\n  // BUILD_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY: root location of your build contract files (.sol.js)\n  // WEB3_PROVIDER_LOCATION: rpc configuration as a string, as a URL needed for web3&#39;s http provider.\n  //\n  build: &quot;webpack&quot;\n}\n\nNote that you&#39;re given ample environment variables with which to integrate with Truffle, detailed above.\nProviding a Custom FunctionYou can also provide a custom build function like the one below. Note you&#39;re given a plethora of information about your project which you can use to integrate tightly with Truffle.\nmodule.exports = {\n  build: function(options, callback) {\n     // Do something when a build is required. `options` contains these values:\n     //\n     // working_directory: root location of the project\n     // contracts: metadata about your contract files, code, etc.\n     // contracts_directory: root directory of .sol files\n     // rpc: rpc configuration defined in the configuration\n     // destination_directory: directory where truffle expects the built assets (important for `truffle serve`)\n  }\n}\n\nCreating a Custom ModuleYou could also create a module or object that implements the builder interface (i.e., is an object which contains a build function like the one above). This is great for those who want to maintain tighter integration with Truffle and publish a package to make everyone else&#39;s lives easier.\nHere&#39;s an example using Truffle&#39;s default builder:\nvar DefaultBuilder = require(&quot;truffle-default-builder&quot;);\nmodule.exports = {\n  build: new DefaultBuilder(...) // specify the default builder configuration here.\n}\n\nBootstrapping Your FrontendBecause you&#39;re using a custom build process, Truffle no longer knows how to bootstrap your frontend. You&#39;ll need to do this yourself. Here&#39;s a list of things your build process and/or application will need to do:\n\nInclude the Web3 library.\nInitialize a web3 instance and set a provider that points to your desired ethereum client. It&#39;s important to detect if the web3 object already exists, as it might already be available if someone is viewing your application via a wallet-browser like Metamask or Mist. If the web3 object already exists, you should use that instead of initializing your own. See this example for more details.\nrequire or import the built sol.js files from the ./build/contracts directory. For each .sol.js file, set the provider using the MyContract.setProvider() method. This should the same provider your web3 instance is using. Using web3.currentProvider is recommended:\n\nvar MyContract = require(&quot;./build/contracts/MyContract.sol.js&quot;);\nMyContract.setProvider(web3.currentProvider);\n\nUsing WebpackWe&#39;re still working on having tighter integration with Webpack. However, checkout this example) and let us know how it works for you.\n"},"commands":{"id":"commands","title":"Command Reference","path":"advanced/commands","content":"Usage $ truffle [command] [options]\n\nAvailable CommandsbuildBuild a development version of the app; creates the ./build directory.\n$ truffle build\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n--dist: Build a distributable version of the app. Only applicable when using the default builder.\n\nSee the Building your application section for more details.\nconsoleRun a console with your contract objects instantiated and ready to use.\n$ truffle console\n\nOnce the console starts, you can then use your contracts via the command line like you would in your code.
